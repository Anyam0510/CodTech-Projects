## 1. ETL Pipeline with Scikit-learn & Pandas

**Description:**  
A modular Jupyter Notebook that automates the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using `pandas` and `scikit-learn`. It includes preprocessing pipelines for numerical and categorical features.

**Features:**
- ColumnTransformer with pipelines
- Scaling, imputation, encoding
- Saves cleaned CSV and serialized pipeline

##  2. Image Classification with TensorFlow

**Description:**  
A deep learning project using CNN to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Includes training, validation, and visualizations of model performance.

**Features:**
- CNN with Keras
- Accuracy/Loss plots
- Sample predictions displayed

혖 File: `Image_Classification_CNN_TensorFlow.ipynb`

## 3. Iris Classifier API using FastAPI + Docker

**Description:**  
A full ML deployment project. Trains a RandomForest on the Iris dataset and serves it via a FastAPI application with Docker support.

**Features:**
- FastAPI endpoint `/predict`
- Dockerfile for containerization
- Render.com ready

혖 Files:
- `model_training.py`
- `app_fastapi.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- `Dockerfile`

## 4. Linear Programming Optimization with PuLP

**Description:**  
A business problem modeled as a production planning scenario. Uses `PuLP` for linear programming and visualizes the optimal solution.

**Features:**
- Objective: Maximize profit
- Constraints: Labor and materials
- Visualization + insights

혖 File: `Optimization_Business_Problem.ipynb`
